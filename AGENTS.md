# NotaFlow: AI Router

NotaFlow is a multi-tenant web app that issues, copies, and cancels Brazilian service invoices (NFS-e) through the national system. The design is in the [RFC](docs/ENGINEERING/RFCS/2026/10/RFC_NFSE_EMITTER.md). The current work is the [Stage 0 plan](docs/ENGINEERING/PLANS/2026/10/PLAN_STAGE_0_SPIKE.md).

## Project-wide rules

1. Never use TypeScript non-null assertions (`value!`). ESLint enforces it.
2. A credential never enters git. Tests use `@notaflow/test-kit` certificates and synthetic data. Never pass `--no-verify`. See [Secrets](docs/ENGINEERING/CONVENTIONS/SECRETS.md).
3. Amounts are integer cents in code. A CNPJ is a 14-character string `[0-9A-Z]`.
4. From Stage 1a, every database query goes through a repository that requires the account context.
5. Comments are a budget: one line, only the non-obvious why. See [Code Comments](docs/ENGINEERING/CONVENTIONS/CODE_COMMENTS.md).
6. Every English text follows the [Writing Style](docs/ENGINEERING/CONVENTIONS/WRITING_STYLE.md): inverted pyramid, Simplified Technical English, no em dash.
7. Commits and PRs carry no AI attribution.
8. Scripts must run on Windows and Linux. No `VAR=value cmd` prefixes.

| --- | --- |
| `pnpm lint` | ESLint on the whole repo |
| `pnpm typecheck` | `tsc` in every package |
| `pnpm test` | Vitest on the whole repo |
| `pytest services/signer-py` | Python signer tests |
