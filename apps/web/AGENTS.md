# Web: AI Context

The React UI, built with Vite and styled with the Malphas design system. It talks only to the server API under `/api`. See [Web UI](../../docs/ENGINEERING/ARCHITECTURE/WEB_UI.md).

## Quick Reference

- Entry: `src/main.tsx`; routes: `src/router.ts` (hash routes); API client and types: `src/api.ts`
- Run: `pnpm dev:web` (proxies `/api` to `127.0.0.1:3000`); build: `pnpm build:web` (the server serves `apps/web/dist`)
- Tests: Vitest with jsdom (`// @vitest-environment jsdom` at the top of a component test, and `cleanup()` after each test)

## Key Rules

1. UI text is in Brazilian Portuguese; code and comments are in English.
2. Amounts arrive in cents; format them only with `formatCents`.
3. Every API error code has a message in `ERROR_TEXT` (`src/components/Layout.tsx`).
4. The environment badge is always visible where an emitter or invoice is shown.
5. Use the components in `src/ui`; never a raw color. Do not edit `src/malphas/` (copied from Malphas; see its `SOURCE.md`).
